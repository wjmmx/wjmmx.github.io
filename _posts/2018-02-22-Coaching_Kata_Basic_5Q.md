# 辅导对话的5个问题

通常教练在一次辅导对话中会通过这5个问题的问与答，来达到下面两个目的：

1. 加强对Improvement Kata模式的应用
1. 帮助辅导对象对自己的想法的认知更加成熟，在需要的情况下教练可以给予合适的反馈

## Dialogue's English Version

Good morning Alan.
Morning Dwayne good to see you again. I really appreciate you taking the time to meet with me this morning. I really would like to just get going and understanding a little bit more about the challenge that you and the rest of the side are working to accomplish.
A challenge in the prime Madison value stream is to increase our production rate by 500 trades per shift to six on a trades per shift and we need to accomplish this with our existing headcount.
okay, great. So now let's take it down level and talk a little bit more about how that relates to you and your team what is the target ition that you're striving to achieve.
Well. Supplies inspection our piece of the value stream. we need to establish a workflow system in this area that's both planned and leveled.

Okay and by when are you looking to achieve this.
By the end of the year which is four months from now

Okay. So teach me and tell me a little bit more about how then this target condition relates back to the challenge that you just shared?
Well. We need additional capacity and we predict that if we can get our work into a planned and level state and we'll have the capacity support the value stream challenge.
Okay. Very good. So then what is actually happening now?
Currently our work is 80% unplanned and it's not leveled
Okay there are a number of interruptions that occur throughout the day that that create this unplanned state and you can see them in this graph here.
Wow! Okay. Very good. All right. So let's move on. So then what obstacles do you think are preventing you from achieving your target condition?

We have four obstacles that we've identified. One being that deliveries come in batches. We get a large number of batches of materials at one time. Another being interruptions and in particular the supplies inspection personnel being interrupted to go back into the warehouse and direct the movement of materials.
Okay
A third was is the occasional high reject rate of in particular materials that come in. And the fourth was that everyone won the spot suspection. Team is not cross trained to do all activities.
Okay very good. Sounds comprehensive. So which one you're addressing now?
Now we're working on the supplies inspection personnel going into the warehouse to direct the movement of materials the interruptions that that activity causes.
okay great so let's take a step back and let's reflect on the last step that you took in order to address this obstacle.
let's say I walked through so what was the step that you took
Well. My step was to try to have the receivers in the warehouse direct material movement.
Okay.And what did you expect?
We expected really just to learn what we needed to work on.
Okay.
And to be able to make that transition all right.
what actually happened though?
Well. What happened is that the receivers didn't have the sampling plan. It didn't know how to interpret the ANSI tables so they didn't have the information they needed to direct material movement.
All right. And then the end what did you learn?
We learned that the receivers need additional information and some instruction.
Okay. So share with me now if you will the next step that you plan on taking your next cycle.
Our next step is to assess the information that the receivers will need to be able to direct material movement
Okay so tell me a little bit more about how you plan on taking that step
Well. We currently have a sampling plan that has a lot of information in it and so we want to go through that and identify which pieces the receivers need for directing material movement is that and who will do that I'll probably sit down with that plan and and go through and try to determine which pieces of information are needed look how good
And what do you expect with this step?
Well. We expect to learn what we need to put into a job age for the receivers.
Okay great.
so then one k-- we go see what you have learned from taking this next step.
tomorrow afternoon we should have identified the information that the receivers need
okay great
well I really appreciate you taking the time to meet with me this this morning. And that sounds like you guys are well on your way. I really encourage you and the team to continue following the scientific process that you takin. well done!
Thank you!

## 对话的中文版

早上好，艾伦。
Morning Dwayne很高兴再次见到你。我很感激你今天早上花时间与我见面。我真的很想继续前进，更多地了解你和其他人正在努力完成的挑战。
麦迪逊首要价值流中的挑战是将每班的500次交易的生产速度提高到每班6次，我们需要通过现有员工来完成。
好的，太好了。所以，现在让我们把它降低一级，并多谈一些与你和你的团队相关的问题，你正在努力实现的目标是什么。
好。供应商检查我们的价值流。我们需要在这个既有计划又有平坦的领域建立工作流程系统。

好吧，你什么时候想要达到这个目标？
到现在为止的四个月的年底

好的。所以，请教我并告诉我更多关于这种目标状况如何与您刚分享的挑战联系起来的问题？
好。我们需要额外的能力，我们预测如果我们能够将我们的工作纳入计划和水平的状态，并且我们将有能力支持价值流挑战。
好的。很好。那么现在究竟发生了什么？
目前我们的工作是80％未计划的，并且不平等
好的，一整天都会发生一些中断，导致这种计划外状态，您可以在此图中看到它们。
哇！好的。很好。好吧。所以我们继续前进。那么，你认为什么障碍阻止你实现目标条件？

我们已经确定了四个障碍。一种是分批交货。我们同时获得大量批次的材料。另一个是中断，特别是供应检查人员被打断，返回仓库并指导材料的移动。
好的
第三个是偶尔出现的特定材料的高拒绝率。第四个是每个人都赢得了现场怀疑。团队没有经过交叉培训来完成所有活动。
好，非常好。听起来很全面。那么你现在处理哪一个？
现在我们正在处理进入仓库的物资检查人员，以指导物料移动导致该活动造成的中断。
好吧，让我们退后一步，让我们思考为了解决这个障碍而采取的最后一步。
让我们说，我走过了，所以你采取了哪些步骤
好。我的一步是尝试让仓库中的接收器直接进行材料移动。
好，你期望什么？
我们期望真正了解我们需要开展的工作。
好的。
并且能够完成这一转变。
究竟发生了什么？
好。发生的事是接收机没有抽样计划。它不知道如何解释ANSI表格，因此他们没有指导材料移动所需的信息。
好吧。然后最终你学到了什么？
我们了解到接收器需要额外的信息和一些指令。
好的。所以，现在就与我分享，如果你愿意下一步，你打算进行下一个周期。
我们的下一步是评估接收器需要能够指导材料移动的信息
好，那么告诉我更多关于你如何计划采取这一步骤的信息
好。我们目前有一个抽样计划，其中有很多信息，所以我们希望通过这些计划来确定接收者需要哪些指导物质移动的部分，谁会这样做，我可能会按照该计划坐下来，并通过并尝试确定需要哪些信息看起来有多好
你对这一步有什么期待？
好。我们希望了解我们需要将接收机投入工作年龄。
好的，太好了。
那么就有一个k--我们去看看你从下一步开始学到了什么。
明天下午我们应该确定接收者需要的信息
好的，太好了
我很感激你今天早上花时间与我见面。这听起来像你们正在顺利的路上。我真的鼓励你和团队继续遵循你羚牛的科学进程。做得好！
谢谢！
