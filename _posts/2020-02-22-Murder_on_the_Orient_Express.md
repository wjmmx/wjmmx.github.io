[赫尔克里波洛给阿姆斯特朗的回信]

亲爱的阿姆斯特朗上校，我终于可以回信给你。通过我的思绪，通过我心灵的震颤。在某个地方，我相信你能听得到我的声音。我已经查出本案的真相。这个结果令我非常不安。我看到了人性的破碎。那么多不幸的生命，那么多的痛苦与愤恨，被心底的悲痛侵蚀并支配着。一起罪行最终引变成无数起。
我一直想相信人是理性而且文明的。我的生命依赖于这个充满了希望和秩序的信仰。但现在，我可能必须做些转变，聆听我内心的声音。

[赫尔克里波洛给其他乘客们，即凶手们的最后的话]

女士们先生们，通过这个案子我意识到正义的天平未必永远都能维持平衡。而这也让我头一次学会了接受这个世界的不平衡。车上没有杀人凶手，只有需要重生的人。警方已经接受了我的第一种结论：凶手单独作案并且成功逃逸。我将在此下车办理后续的结案手续。你们都能自由离开了。希望你们能就此获得安宁。希望我们都能获得。

[The reply to Armstrong, from Hercule Poirot]
My dear Colonel Armstrong. Finally, I can answer your letter. At least with the thoughts in my head and the feeling in my heart... that somewhere,you can hear me. I have now discovered the truth of the case, and it is profoundly disturbing. I have seen the fracture of the human soul. So many broken lives, so much pain and anger giving way to the poison of deep grief until one crime became many. I have always wanted to believe that man is rational and civilized. My very existence depends upon this hope upon order and method and the little gray cells. But now, perhaps, I am asked to listen instead to my heart.

[The last words to the murders from Hercule Poirot]
Ladies and gentlemen, I have understood in this case that the scales of justice cannot always be evenly weighed. And I must learn, for once to live with the imbalance. There are no killers here. Only people who deserve a chance to heal. The police have accepted my first solution to the crime the lone assassin who made his escape. I will leave the train hereto conclude formalities. You are all free to go. And may you find your peace with this. May we all.
